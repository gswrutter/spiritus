Re: creating a new /home partition and moving old /home in LVM disk
First you need to see how much are you using on / so that you know whether it can fit in 15GB. You can do that with:
df -h
If the current / usage is less than 15GB, you can shrink the root LV to 15GB, then create a new home LV with the size you want. Since it's a LV you don't need to give it 440GB right away, you can resize later.
Note that when shrinking the root LV it's VERY IMPORTANT to shrink the filesystem first, and after that the LV.
After creating the home LV and copying the data there, you will have to create an entry in /etc/fstab to mount this LV as /home.
That is the general procedure.

I wanted to note, the way I do it is I shrink the filesystem to smaller than the intended size, shirnk the lv to the real intended size, than grow the filesystem to fit, I do this to avoid accidental truncation and thus breakage of the file system.

Remember, every command I give here is just an example, you will need to adjust the voumes and volume groups and sizes to the real values. Post questions if you are unsure about anything.
======
All of this will have to be done from a live cd, since you can't shrink a live file system. (You can grow one however)
Also when I use logical volumes, I tend to leave unallocated, space, since it's a trivial matter to grow them if needed (I also use it to create snapshots while I'm backing up).

Just giving you an example let's say I have a logical volume "backup" 40 GB's on the volume group "ubuntu" and I wanted to shrink it to 20GB's, I would do it like this.

First command checks to see what the minimum size is, let's pretend it's lower than 20GB's so I proceed, the second command reduces the volume to it's minimum size, the 4th reduces the logical volume to 20GB's, the last command causes the filesystem to fill up the logical volume.
Code:
sudo resize2fs -P /dev/ubuntu/backup
sudo e2fsck -f /dev/ubuntu/backup
sudo resize2fs -M /dev/ubuntu/backup
sudo lvresize ubuntu/backup -L 20GB
sudo resize2fs /dev/ubuntu/backup
Now you want to create a home volume on the ubuntu volume group, easy as cake, let's pretend you want it to be 100 GB's
Code:
sudo lvcreate -n home -L 100G ubuntu
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/ubuntu/home
Then you copy your old home to the new home and add an fstab entry

Code:
sudo mkdir /mnt/root
sudo mkdir /mnt/newhome
sudo mount /dev/ubuntu/root /mnt/root
sudo mount /dev/ubuntu/home /mnt/newhome
sudo rsync -avr /mnt/root/home/ /mnt/newhome/
gksu gedit /mnt/root/etc/fstab
when gedit opens, add this line at the bottom, click save then exit.

Code:
/dev/ubuntu/home /home ext4 defaults 0 2
Confirm everything copied by browsing to /mnt/newhome in nautilus and ensuring it looks right, once your sure it all copied.
Clean up what was in your old home and reboot
Code:
sudo rm -r /mnt/root/home/*
sudo reboot

Smile [SOLVED] Re: creating a new /home partition and moving old /home in LVM disk
Thanks for the steps...I followed your guide, Jerome and it worked well until I rebooted, upon which the boot splash screen displayed a message to the effect that there was a problem mounting, press s to skip or m to recover manually.
at first I was worried that something failed, so I started up from a live CD and used a few commands to mount and confirm that my root and home partitions still existed. Then I realized the problem was with fstab.
I reviewed your suggested line to add in fstab:
/dev/ubuntu/home ext4 defaults 0 2
and altered it to:
/dev/ubuntu/home /home ext4 defaults 0 2
which solved the problem, and things working well now.
I will mark this as solved.
