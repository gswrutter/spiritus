Configuration scripts for my portable Arch-based desktop.

The purpose of this repo is to contain all the configuration scripts that I might use to rebuilt the system.

This system is designed to be lightweight, secure, multi-purpose, and capable of running on a number of my devices, including a 2-1 high-end laptop, and my desktop/server running KVM with a gaming Windows VM; all of this from a USB thumbdrive optimized to reduce reads/writes.

Checklist of thing to investigate:
- [ ] Optimizing directories to tmpfs.
- [ ] KVM
